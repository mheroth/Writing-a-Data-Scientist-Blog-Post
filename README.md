# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data to better understand:
- Which accommodations have the best ratio of rating and price mean_rating/price
- What are the busiest months of the year to visit Seattle? Is this related to prices?
- Is it always cheapest to look for your actual group size in Seattle? Or should I also look for larger accommodations as the total price could be lower?
- How many accommodations are there for larger groups?
- What is the price for the most expensive night for a person in Seattle?

Overall, the results should give an assessment of the current situation of the accommodations in Seattle and be a help with the next booking. With the results, it should be possible to give recommendations on when is the best time to travel for certain target groups and how best to look for the cheapest accommodation for groups.

# File Description
There is one  notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available:
