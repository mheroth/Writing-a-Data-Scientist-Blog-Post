# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data to better understand:
- Which accommodations have the best ratio of rating and price mean_rating/price
- What are the busiest months of the year to visit Seattle? Is this related to prices?
- Is it always cheapest to look for your actual group size in Seattle? Or should I also look for larger accommodations as the total price could be lower?
- How many accommodations are there for larger groups?
- What is the price for the most expensive night for a person in Seattle?
